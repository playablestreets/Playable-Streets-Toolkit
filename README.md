Included in this framework are:
- a set sketches for ESP32 and other Arduino type boards for capacitive and resistive touch sensing.
- a set of Pure Data abstractions for
	- communicating with sensors via OSC over wifi and usb-serial.
	- formating and forwarding sense data.
- a set of Max for Live devices for interfacing Ableton Live with the framework.
