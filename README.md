# Playable Streets Toolkit
### A cross-platform framework for expressive, touch-based interaction design.

Included in this framework are:
- a set sketches for ESP32 and other Arduino type boards for capacitive and resistive touch sensing.
- a set of Pure Data abstractions for
	- communicating with sensors via OSC over wifi and usb-serial.
	- formating and forwarding sense data.
- a set of Max for Live devices for interfacing Ableton Live with the framework.

## Requirements
- Purr Data: https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/
- Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software


And optionally

- Ableton Live: https://www.ableton.com/en/
- with Max for Live: https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/
